# My Logic
- find delimiter.
- replace all \n with delimiters.
- Split our string with delimiter.
- lastly try to convert string number into integer.

# Another logic
- We could used stack.

# Scope of Improvements
1. SOLID Principles could be followed.
2. Code can be divided into 2 classes.
      - Calculate Class.
      - String to number Converter class.
